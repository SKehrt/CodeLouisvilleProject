S Kehrt Photography Page for Code Louisville Project

I created a webpage to showcase my portrait photography. 
It includes multiple subjects of whom I have taken their portrait.
I am highlighting the versatility of the photo shoots. 
Once the full site is complete, clicking on each subject will take the site visitor to that subject's page, showing multiple different images and moods I was able to catch on film, during just one shoot.

I have included three JavaScript functions for alert Boxes pertaining to the informational Buttons: 'About Stephanie', 'Prices' and "Contact Information'.

I have also included CSS bboth inline and selectors: the color of the font for the title, subtitle and the names of the different photo styles under the images, the images I chose and included for each cateogry and the footer I used under the buttons to state I created the page..
